# Vanimol
A Lethal Company QoL Modpack that DOESN'T give a single advantage in skill based situations.

## Why choose this modpack instead of other Vanilla/Client-Side Only ones?
Here's one huge problem I have with those. **They always adds something that gives you an advantage**. These modpacks always adds crap like removing the jump delay, which I find very problematic because I'm somewhat of a purist. The philosophy of this modpack is that none of the added mods should give you an advantage in any situations, even in the smallest ones (for example, I refuse to add mods that makes switching items faster as it gives you an advantage when you want to drop off all your items when you want to evade a Forest Giant).
