# Vanimol
A Lethal Company QoL Modpack that DOESN'T give a single advantage in skill based situations.

## Why choose this modpack instead of other Vanilla/Client-Side Only ones?
Here's one huge problem I have with those. **They always adds something that gives you an advantage**. These modpacks always adds crap like removing the jump delay, which I find very problematic because I'm somewhat of a purist. The philosophy of this modpack is that none of the added mods should give you an advantage in any situations, even in the smallest ones (for example, I refuse to add mods that makes switching items faster as it gives you an advantage when you want to drop off all your items when you want to evade a Forest Giant).

## NOTICE
This modpack ships with HDLethalCompany cranked to the maximum (without affecting render resolution, because that's cheating in my eyes), this means that yes, shadows and volumetric lighting are improved, but this will lag your game. Don't forget to modify the HDLethalCompany settings after installing this modpack.
